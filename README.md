# INTRODUCTION

This is a React project where you'll build a web app that displays a list of available bots, among other features. You'll be working with components, props, state, events, and data fetching in React. You must fetch data from a local server running JSON DB server.

The core deliverables are:

See profiles of all bots rendered in BotCollection.
Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it.
Release a bot from my army by clicking on it.
Discharge a bot from their service forever by clicking the red button marked "x".
